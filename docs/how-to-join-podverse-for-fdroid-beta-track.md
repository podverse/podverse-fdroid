# How to join the Podverse for F-Droid Beta track

In order to join the Podverse for F-Droid Beta track and automatically receive updates when a new version of the F-Droid Beta is available, you will need to add the Podverse for F-Droid repository to the F-Droid app. Below is a step-by-step guide for joining the Podverse for F-Droid Beta track:

1) Open F-Droid on your Android device.

Troubleshooting

> I followed the steps, but I am still not seeing the Podverse Beta version when I search in F-Droid.

You may need to disable the standard F-Droid repo on the Repositories screen, so only the Podverse F-Droid Repo is enabled, then repeat steps 8-11.
