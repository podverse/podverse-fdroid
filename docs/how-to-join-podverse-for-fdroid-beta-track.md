# How to join the Podverse for F-Droid Beta track

In order to join the Podverse for F-Droid Beta track and automatically receive updates when a new version of the F-Droid Beta is available, you will need to add the Podverse for F-Droid repository to the F-Droid app. Below is a step-by-step guide for joining the Podverse for F-Droid Beta track:

1) If you already have the non-beta version of Podverse for F-Droid installed, you will need to delete that version from your device first.
2) Open F-Droid on your Android device.
3) Tap the Settings tab in the bottom right.
4) Tap the Repositories option.
5) Tap the add (+) icon in the upper-right corner.
6) In the "Add new repository" window, type https://files.podverse.fm/fdroid/repo/ as the Repository address. You can leave the "Fingerprint (optional)" field blank. Then tap Add.
7) You should now see a repo named "Podverse F-Droid Repo" on the Repositories list. The toggle should be enabled.
8) Now go back to the Latest tab in the F-Droid app, and pull down to refresh, to ensure you have all the latest repositories.
9) After the Latest tab finishes refreshing, tap the search icon in the bottom right.
10) Search for "podverse"
11) You should see the Podverse Beta option as the top result. It should have a description like "Podverse Beta F-Droid, faster releases when they are built!"
12) Tap the Podverse Beta option, and install the latest Beta release. Note that the app's description contains the latest version's release notes (so you know what features and fixes are in the latest version).

That's it! You should now automatically receive updates for new Podverse F-Droid Beta releases. Thank you for your help testing Podverse ❤️

Troubleshooting

> I followed the steps, but I am still not seeing the Podverse Beta version when I search in F-Droid.

You may need to disable the standard F-Droid repo on the Repositories screen, so only the Podverse F-Droid Repo is enabled, then repeat steps 8-11.
