# Attention: Send PRs to the [podverse-rn repo](https://github.com/podverse/podverse-rn) instead of this one :)

The podverse-fdroid repo is downstream from the podverse-rn repo. Both repos are identical, except podverse-fdroid has a small amount of changes specific to it, such as the Podverse F-Droid build config and assets, our Azure F-Droid build pipeline, the removal of Matomo tracking code, and the removal of other libraries.

If you'd like to add features or a bug fix to the Podverse mobile app, please make those changes in [podverse-rn](https://github.com/podverse/podverse-rn) instead of podverse-fdroid, _unless_ you're absolutely sure these changes should only apply to the podverse-fdroid build.

## FAQ:

### Why do some clips start at the wrong time?

Most podcast apps today limit clips to be less than a minute, but Podverse allows creating and sharing clips of any length. \
The current approach has the drawback of not supporting clips from podcasts that insert dynamic ads.

Dynamic ads are different advertisements rotated into the same episode, so each listener can hear a different series of advertisements. \
Since dynamic ads change the overall length of the episode, timestamps of clips created from that episode may be inaccurate.

Full support for podcasts with dynamic ads is possible, but for fair use/legal reasons permission from each podcaster is needed to do so.

### What does the license (AGPLv3) mean?
AGPLv3 is the license of all Podverse software. Anyone can use, inspect, change and share freely, as long as everyone gets to share the software. \
This is also known as a "share-alike" or "copyleft" license.

### Why is Podverse free as in freedom?
Podverse software lets anyone launch their own podcast app as affordably as possible. \
Podcast networks can use the Podverse codebase to create their own app for a tiny fraction of what it costs to hire programmers to build a podcast app from scratch.

This levels the playing field between the corporate world and independent media, \
so independent media enjoy the same technological advantages as large corporations. \
Copylefted libre software and donations is essential to that mission.
