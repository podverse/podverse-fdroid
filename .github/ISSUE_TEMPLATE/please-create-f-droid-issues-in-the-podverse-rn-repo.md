Please create Podverse F-Droid issues within the podverse-rn repo!

https://github.com/podverse/podverse-rn

To make it easier to keep track of issues in one location, please create any issues for Podverse for F-Droid in the podverse-rn repo. The dev work for Podverse for F-Droid is typically done within the podverse-rn repo first, and then we pull those changes into podverse-fdroid from podverse-rn after that.
